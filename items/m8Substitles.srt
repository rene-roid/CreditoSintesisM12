Hello, I am Fernando and today I am going to show you what did i learn in the module 8

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and I'm going to show you how to make a webpage in HTML and CSS.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This webpage will be able to play a single song.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
First of all, I need to add the webpage title and I need to link a stylesheet.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now I will add the basic things that the HTML website will have.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
By the way, the webpage will have a background, a song, a pause icon and a play icon.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So now, I will add all the elements that it will have.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I have added a title for the website, a text for the website and also I have added the music icon.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And this is what we have for now.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now that I have all the content that the webiste will have I am going to make the style of the website.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I will make a style for the container, the navigation bar, the content of webpage and the two icons that will add.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ok, I made so ti had a  background image, i made so the navbar is on the top left

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
then also I changed it so that the "Music website" name is in color white in the center of the webpage.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now for make it to work we need to add some JavaScript.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Now I will add a script where, it makes that if the song isn't playing it will play when we click the button

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and if the song is already playing and we click the button it will pause the song instead of playing it again.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now lets see if the website works propertly, this is the webpage and thats it.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Get rick rolled :)
